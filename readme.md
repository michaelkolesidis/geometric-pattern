# Geometric Pattern

![Screenshot](./screenshot.png)

Draw a grid of squares and within each square a geometric graphic is drawn, ranging from simple shapes such as circles and rhombuses, to more complex shapes such as stars and others that resemble a two-pronged axe and a crown. Elements are randomly filled from a palette of red, yellow, green, pink and black. The internal designs of each square grow and shrink over time.
